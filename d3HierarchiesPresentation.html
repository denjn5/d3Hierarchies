# Hierarchical Data: Why? What? How?

---
.context[hierarchical data]
# Our Goal?

By the end of this session,<br>
you should have a<br>
solid understanding,<br>
and a comfort with,<br>
hierarchical datasets.

### We will learn:
* when to use them
* how to interact with them
* several ways to apply them to d3 visuals

---
.context[hierarchical data]
# Agenda
1. *Why* should I care?
2. *What* are they?
3. *How* do I work with them?
4. From data to visual

# Why should I care?

.center[I will, in <b>fact</b>, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
—Linus Torvalds]

Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
—Eric S. Raymond ("ESR", The Cathedral and the Bazaar)

“Data!data!data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay.”
—Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventure of the Copper Beeches

.sectionReminder[Hey]

# Why should I care?

What are some examples of hierarchical data?
* Country / State / City / Street / House

``` json
{
  "continent": "North America",
  "countries": [
    { "country": "Mexico" },
    { "country": "United States",
      "states": [
        { "state": "Indiana" },
        { "state": "California" }
      ]
    },
    { "countries": "Canada",
      "provinces": [
*       { "province": "Quebec" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


```

It’s the natural way to think about some data structures.
Get examples from the class.
Paper & Pencil exercise:  Draw a model of a dataset they work with that is hierarchical.
It’s the bridge to some visualizations [show examples of each]
